Comments:
---------
Nice work on this assignment.

Good analysis on 5.1 and 5.2 ~ complete without being overly verbose.  Nice!

Nice hybrid on 5.4 of using monolithic and service-oriented together!  Good
critical thinking there.

Nice work on the state diagram ~ I bet that was hard, drawing that in Word.

Same for the class diagram.  I respectfully suggest looking into some sort
of straightedge for this kind of drawing so it looks as professional as the
rest of your work.  ...just sayin'....

Good job and you're doing well, Sebastian!!
