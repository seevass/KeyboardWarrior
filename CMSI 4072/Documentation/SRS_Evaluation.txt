Software Requirements Specification Document:
---------------------------------------------
-- Introduction Section
   This section is great!  The diagram adds a lot.  Good work!

-- Functional Requirements
   These are all good and you seem to have put a lot of thought into them.
   The only comment is a general one to all sections: if you find yourself
   making "such as" statements in your requirements, those should become
   "will" statements that are attached to the shall statements you take them
   out of.  For example:

   IS:
   5.2.1.3  The GUI shall show popup information such as player damage dealt
            and received and enemy damage dealt and received

   SHOULD BE:
   5.2.1.3  The GUI shall show popup information to the player.
            Pop up information will include but not be limited to player
            damage dealt, player damage received, enemy damage dealt, and
            enemy damage received.

-- Performance Requirements
   Same comment as above for this section.

-- Environment Requirements
   Same comment as above for this section.

=============================================================================
your score:  9% out of 10% which is an A-minus

All in all, excellent and complete first effort!

Make the changes as suggested above, including many more requirements for
the second submission and you'll get the full 10% on this document.

=============================================================================
SECOND EVALUATION:

your score:  10% out of 10% = 100% which is an A-plus

You did change the language, and it looks great now.  You should still have
more requirements in the functional section, but I think it's good enough to
show that you have the idea of what the requirements doc should look like!

Nice work!
