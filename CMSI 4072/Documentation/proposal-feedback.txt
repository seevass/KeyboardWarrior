CMSI 4072 project ~ Spring 2024
Sebastian Cruz
Keyboard Warrior project
===============================

Proposal Document:
------------------
   Nice work on the document.  The description is wonderful, giving the
   reader a good idea of what the game is all about, and what the ultimate
   focus is.  Typing tutor games are so much more engaging when they are
   actual games, and having placed TypeRacer a few times I can see what
   a boost it will give typists.  Having the game automatically adjust to
   the typist's ability will also help prevent the user being discouraged.

   The justification section is also well done, specifying the focus for
   the game and how it will use some of the concepts you have learned during
   your school experience.  Using Unity will create a wonderful game
   experience, much better than a simple browser-based game [IMHO].  Your
   self-reflection is evident in the way you express that the project will
   make good use of your skills and confidence, and that it won't be a
   'stretch' for you to finish in one semester.

Proposal Presentation:
----------------------
   Good job on the presentation!  The slides look great, your justification
   of both the project goals and the applicability to the course are well-
   thought-out and clear.  This is a very useful project!  Your presentation
   skills were very professional and I like that you are providing fun as
   well as learning.  I also like the way you are using your passion to make
   something that is useful for others.

=============================================================================
your score:  5% out of 5% which is an A-plus

Great job on this presentation and proposal and great start to the semester!
