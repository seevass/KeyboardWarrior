Keyboard Warrior is a typing learning program that takes the form of a roguelike video game. It works on Windows computers and only requires a keyboard. The application provides an entertaining and interactive way for users to improve their typing skills, placing a strong emphasis on accuracy, speed, and ability to handle complexity. Inspired by games like Typing of the Dead and more competitive websites such as TypeRacer, as well as typing-test websites like MonkeyType, Keyboard Warrior in essence is a combination of the elements from current typing games and websites into one program. Its key features include a dynamic scaling of difficulty, ensuring users face progressively challenging typing scenarios as they advance. Each run is aims to have uniqueness through the collection of various skills and items during runs, introducing diversity to the experience. The game's distinguishing feature lies in its typing-based combat system, having users engage in both offensive and defensive maneuvers. This approach aims to not only enhance typing proficiency but also make the learning process enjoyable and attention-grabbing. Keyboard Warrior is designed to appeal to two main groups: those who love roguelike games and are seeking a fresh gaming experience, and computer users aiming to improve or polish their typing skills. With an emphasis on both entertainment and skill development, the program seeks to ultimately make typing more extended and intricate words quickly and accurately a comfortably and achievable challenge.

Keyboard Warrior proves to be a suitable project for this class, serving as a platform for the practical application of skills developed from both Game Design and Game Development. This project offers a unique opportunity to apply the knowledge gained from these classes. By using the fundamental concepts learned in Game Design, the project integrates these principles using the coding knowledge and understanding of Unity acquired through the Game Development class. Having conceptualized Keyboard Warriorâ€™s Minimum Viable Product, the project's technical difficulty aligns well with my existing proficiency in Unity and understanding of game design theory, providing an avenue to explore a game genre I have significant interest in. Drawing from experience in successfully developing a game within a semester, I have confidence in my ability to bring Keyboard Warrior to fruition. Although several game mechanics have been conceptualized, I believe that the core mechanics of the game are simple enough to be reasonably completed before the end of the semester, allowing focused attention on fundamental mechanics initially and room for additional features if time permits. My passion for this projected is rooted in my personal interest in typing, evident in my collection and building of mechanical keyboards, and also my enjoyment of doing typing tests during my free time. I believe this enthusiasm also extends to classmates, apparent in their questions about the game mechanics during the project presentation. Finally, I believe that the project's appeal also extends to our professor, offering a refreshing perspective on typing games and websites. Ultimately, Keyboard Warrior aims to entertain while simultaneously aiding users in developing valuable typing skills.
