Software Development Plan Document:
---------------------------------------------
-- General Comments
   Very nice work on this document!

-- Introduction Section
   Your introduction section is perfect!  There are a couple of very small
   grammar errors but nothing to cause a significant problem.  The section
   for the deliverables is supposed to reflect more than just what is due
   for grade; list the parts of your project as you define them for your
   schedule.

-- Project Resources Section
   Fine, it's a solo project; no further comments, no adjustments needed.

-- Project Organization Section
   Perfect; no further comments, no adjustments needed.

-- Project Schedule Section
   Perfect; no further comments, no adjustments needed.

=============================================================================

the full 10% on this document.

SECOND EVALUATION:

Nice work adding the other deliverables!
